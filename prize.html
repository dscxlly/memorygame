        <div class="description">
            <p>Today, the universe itself celebrates the birth of a truly extraordinary soul - <span>you</span>. You are a force of nature, a beacon of light, and the very essence of everything that is beautiful in this world. From the bottom of my heart, I express my deepest admiration for the incredible person that you are.
            <br><br>
            Your presence fills every moment with warmth, meaning and joy, it's been like that since I started to know you better and you became irreplaceable and indispensable in my life. Sometimes I think I know every single piece and beautiful detail about you but at the same time I feel like I know very little and that's ok, in fact, it makes it all better because I get to learn a new thing every day. <span>I love that!</span>
            <br><br>
            I love when you share the smallest things with me and the deepest, too. It makes me useful when you trust me to tell something that bothers you and I'll never get tired of hearing every detail about your day (even when you have the laziest days).
            <br><br>
            On this special day (even if you don't like, it's still your day), I want to show you my deepest gratitude for having you in my life. I never lie when I say you're the best thing that happened to me in a long time.
            <br><br>
            Now I ask you to do me a little flavor: close your eyes and for a few seconds imagine a cake of yout favorite flavor and as much candles as you want. Make a wish for every candle you imagined... As you blow out those candles, know that my greatest wish to you is happiness and fulfillment in all aspects of life. May the next 365 days bring you more joy and success than you could ever imagine... maybe love, too, who knows!
            <br><br>
            I also wish that one day we can have many adventures together. That's a deep wish for myself, by the way, as I want to keep discovering things that bring me joy and nowadays spending time with you is my favorite one.
            <br><br>
            Happy birthday, my love! You're the universe's greatest gift to me and I'm truly blessed to have you in my life.
            <br><br>
            I can't wait to watch the Niners with you again!
            <br><br>
            I love you! ❤️</p>
